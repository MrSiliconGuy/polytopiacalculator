# Polytopia Battle Calculator

This is a Javascript program that allows you to test for combat results in The Battle of Polytopia. The project is unofficial, but it's updated on a regular basis as the developer releases more content for the game.

To use the calculator, simply go here: https://frothfrenzy.github.io/polytopiacalculator/

In the most recent update, I added the Multi mode where you can create an interactive battlefield and try out a variety of calculations to achieve optimal results. Details on how to use it are in the FAQ.

The FAQ also contains information regarding the calculation formula with its corresponding game mechanics, and the links section steadily grew over time into a decent compilation of game sites, guides and gameplay videos.

If you want to use the calculator offline, download the index.html file on your PC and run it in your browser - press "Clone or download", followed by "Download ZIP", and then extract the file. The calculator FAQ contains more information on how to run it offline both on iOS and Android.

[Contact me](mailto:frothdiscord@gmail.com) if you have any suggestions or bug reports. Also, if you have any quality guides or gameplay videos that aren't listed in the FAQ links section, let me know.

Happy battling!
